# BFSWordnet
A Breadth-First Search algorithm that searches a Wordnet of hypernyms and determines their definitions and connections.

The BFS Wordnet is a standard computer science project that utilizes the BFS algorithm to search a large dataset of hypernyms and their definitions. 
The program reads the synonyms and hypernyms files into HashMap structures and prepares them for searching. The user is then asked to ask a question
of the bot: either a "what is blank" or a "is blank a blank" question. The algorithm then searches for the set of definitions or if the two options
have a connection respectfully, using a Breadth-First Search.
